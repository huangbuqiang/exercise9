  <p style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="Photography education.jpg"style="width:600px;height:480px;">
    <p style="font-size:20px;">Photography classes in universities usually tell a lot of theoretical knowledge according to textbooks. For photography lovers, theory is important, but it can't be at the expense of our interest in photography. Commercial photography training institutions will teach you to take qualified commercial photography photos in the shortest time, but too much emphasis on modular teaching can not guide students to find their own characteristics, which will pinch students into ordinary shutter pressing robots without personality. Obviously, we need more relaxed, effective and responsible photography training. The photography class of Mantu education is relaxed, pleasant and productive. What we want to teach is actually very simple: one is aesthetics, the other is realization. I need to teach students to think and find their own aesthetic perspective, and then learn to use the camera to realize and express it. I will not preach rigid "requirements", nor will I have the same aesthetic "standards" - everyone's personality is different, so you should create completely different photography works that only belong to you.</p>

  <h1 style="font-size:20px;text-align: center;">Course plan</h1>

  <h1 style="font-size:30px;text-align: center;background-color:#ffcccc;">Makeup Education</h1>

  <p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="Post education.jpg"style="width:600px;height:480px;">

  <p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="ps.jpg"style="width:600px;height:480px;">
  <p style="font-size:20px;">PS is more and more widely used in the workplace, and enterprises pay more and more attention to the visual aesthetic effect, so they are more willing to hire job seekers with a variety of design skills at a higher salary. This course has many employment directions. It is very suitable for entrepreneurs and people who lack skills.

  <p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="shinei.jpg"style="width:600px;height:480px;">
    <p style="font-size:20px;">The global architectural decoration industry is developing rapidly. China's architectural decoration interior design industry is facing the competition and impact of its peers in the world. It is both an opportunity and a challenge. The rapid rise of China's interior decoration design industry has made remarkable achievements, with booming market demand and a wide range of service fields. It has formed a new consumption hotspot and a new economic growth point. The acceleration of urbanization, the prosperity of housing industry and the further opening of domestic and foreign markets will bring broader development space for the interior decoration design industry.</p>
  <p style="font-size:20px;">Which is the advantage of this courseï¼Ÿ</p>
  <p style="font-size:20px;">1. Large gap: with the development of real estate, interior design and decoration, engineering manufacturing and other industries, the demand for interior design professionals has doubled.</p>
  <p style="font-size:20px;">2. High income: the salary of interior designer is the calculation method of base salary + commission. Generally, for a designer who can complete the design scheme independently, the amount of commission is 3-8% of the project fund. Therefore, the more orders are received, the larger the design area and the higher the income.
